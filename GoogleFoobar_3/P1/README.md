# Level 3: Problem 1 #

## Problem: Given n blocks how many possible stair cases can be generated ##
Where stair case is defined as:
- Using all n blocks
- Every Staircase has at least 2 steps
- Every level must be greater than the previous (ex. if current level of stairs is 3 then next must be >= 4)

Example:
Given 3 blocks, 1 staircase is possible
%
% %

Given 5 blocks, 2 staircase are possible
%       
%       %
%       % %
% %     % %
